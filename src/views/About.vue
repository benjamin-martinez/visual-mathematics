    This inspiration behind this project came as a result of constantly being told over and over again that math is hard. 
    To me, "math is hard" breaks down into 2 things. Math can be boring, and math can be difficult to abstract. Maybe it's 
    so difficult to abstract because it's boring. Either way, I see this as a problem that can be corrected via the right visuals.
    Organizations such as Wolphram Alpha have done wonders to solve this problem but I've decided to take my own shot at it and 
    see if I can come up with anything better.
